## Overview

### Description

I present to you a small project I made. The main objective was to work with HTML, CSS and Flexbox to perfect my knowledge with those technologies.
It consist of a simple article listing containing a header and a main with three article, each containing an image, a title and a date of publication.
This project works on all device, from smartphone to desktop computer !

## My process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5
  - CSS
  - Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I've practiced some semantic HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The following snippets are some examples of the knowledges I used.

  - Semantic HTML5 (```<header>```):

```
    <header>
      <h1>We release interesting articles about technology</h1>
      <img src="./assets/images/Seperator.svg" alt="A simple seperator made of slashes" aria-hidden="true" width="180px"> 
    </header>
```

  - CSS (```<h1>```):
```
h1 {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 600;
  max-width: 35rem;
  margin: 2rem auto;
}
```

  - Flexbox (```<div>```):

```
div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 32rem;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

Seeing how Flexbox is useful, I will continue to master this technologie.
I will do that by using it on other project, notably to make responsive design.
